# JEMS #

## Introduction ##

JEMS, or the Java Extensible Media Server, is a server framework for maintaining a central repository of media (video, music, images, etc.) and allowing it to be accessed as easily as possible across a local network via various media sharing protocols and services.

The main driving force is complete customization through an XML configuration file so that a specific site's unique needs can be handled without the unneeded extra features.
